<body>
Oft, in the stilly night,
   Ere slumber's chain has bound me,
Fond Memory brings the light
   Of other days around me:
      The smiles, the tears
      Of boyhood's years,
   The words of love then spoken;
      The eyes that shone,
      Now dimm'd and gone,
   The cheerful hearts now broken!
Thus, in the stilly night,
   Ere slumber's chain has bound me,
Sad Memory brings the light
   Of other days around me.

When I remember all
   The friends, so link'd together,
I've seen around me fall
   Like leaves in wintry weather,
      I feel like one
      Who treads alone
   Some banquet-hall deserted,
      Whose lights are fled,
      Whose garlands dead,
   And all but he departed!
Thus, in the stilly night,
   Ere slumber's chain has bound me.
Sad Memory brings the light
   Of other days around me.

   <firstline>Sweet lady, look not thus again</firstline>

<body>
Sweet lady, look not thus again:
Those bright, deluding smiles recall
A maid remember'd now with pain,
Who was my love, my life, my all!

Oh! while this heart bewildered took
Sweet poison from her thrilling eye,
Thus would she smile and lisp and look,
And I would hear and gaze and sigh!

Yes, I did love her - wildly love -
She was her sex's best deceiver!
And oft she swore she'd never rove -
And I was destined to believe her!

Then, lady, do not wear the smile
Of one whose smile could thus betray;
Alas! I think the lovely wile
Again could steal my heart away.

For, when those spells that charmed my mind
On lips so pure as thine I see,
I fear the heart which she resigned
Will err again and fly to thee!

If all the daughters of the sun 
Have loving looks and eyes of flame. 
Go, tell me not that she is one — 
'Twas from the wintry moon she came

And yet, sweet eye ! thou ne'er wert given 
To kindle what thou dost not feel; 
And yet, thou flushing lip — by heaven! 
Thou ne'er wert made for Dian's seal! 

Oh! for a sunbeam, rich and warm 
From thy own Ganges' fervid haunts. 
To light thee up, thou lovely fonn! 
To all my soul adores and wants: 

To see thee burn — to faint and sigh 
Upon that bosom as it blaz'd. 
And be myself the first to die. 
Amid the flame myself had rais'd!

Oh! if your tears are given to care,

Come to my bosom, weeping fair!

But if with Fancy's visioned fears,
    With dreams of woe your bosom thrill;
You look so lovely in your tears,

   <title>To Cara, After An Interval Of Absence</title>
   <firstline>Concealed within the shady wood</firstline>
   <quality>korrektur1</quality>
</head>
<body>
Concealed within the shady wood
    A mother left her sleeping child,
And flew, to cull her rustic food,
    The fruitage of the forest wild.

But storms upon her pathway rise,
    The mother roams, astray and weeping;
Far from the weak appealing cries
    Of him she left so sweetly sleeping.

She hopes, she fears; a light is seen,
    And gentler blows the night wind's breath;
Yet no - 'tis gone - the storms are keen,
    The infant may be chilled to death!

Perhaps, even now, in darkness shrouded,
    His little eyes lie cold and still; -
And yet, perhaps, they are not clouded,
    Life and love may light them still.

Thus, Cara, at our last farewell,
    When, fearful even thy hand to touch,
I mutely asked those eyes to tell
    If parting pained thee half so much:

I thought, - and, oh! forgive the thought,
    For none was e'er by love inspired
Whom fancy had not also taught
    To hope the bliss his soul desired.

Yes, I think, in Cara's mind,
    Though yet to that sweet mind unknown,
I left one infant wish behind,
    One feeling, which I called my own.

Oh blest! though but in fancy blest,
    How did I ask of Pity's care,
To shield and strengthen, in thy breast,
    The nursling I had cradled there.

And, many an hour, beguiled by pleasure,
    And many an hour of sorrow numbering,
I ne'er forgot the new-born treasure,
    I left within thy bosom slumbering.

Perhaps, indifference has not chilled it,
    Haply, it yet a throb may give -
Yet, no - perhaps, a doubt has killed it;
    Say, dearest - the feeling live?

   <title>A Study From The Antique</title>
   <firstline>Behold, my love, the curious gem</firstline>
   <quality>korrektur1</quality>
</head>
<body>
Behold, my love, the curious gem
    Within this simple ring of gold;
'Tis hallow'd by the touch of them
    Who lived in classic hours of old.

Some fair Athenian girl, perhaps,
    Upon her hand this gem displayed,
Nor thought that time's succeeding lapse
    Should see it grace a lovelier maid.

Look, dearest, what a sweet design!
    The more we gaze, it charms the more;
Come - closer bring that cheek to mine,
    And trace with me its beauties o'er.

Thou seest, it is a simple youth
    By some enamored nymph embraced -
Look, as she leans, and say in sooth
    Is not that hand most fondly placed?

Upon his curled head behind
    It seems in careless play to lie,
Yet presses gently, half inclined
    To bring the truant's lip more nigh.

Oh happy maid! Too happy boy!
    The one so fond and little loath,
The other yielding slow to joy -
    Oh rare, indeed, but blissful both.

Imagine, love, that I am he,
    And just as warm as he is chilling;
Imagine, too, that thou art she,
    But quite as coy as she is willing:

So may we try the graceful way
    In which their gentle arms are twined,
And thus, like her, my hand I lay
    Upon thy wreathed locks behind:

And thus I feel thee breathing sweet,
    As slow to mine thy head I move;
And thus our lips together meet,
    And thus, - and thus, - I kiss thee, love.

<nonum><center>* * * * *</center></nonum>

There's not a look, a word of thine,
    My soul hath e'er forgot;
Thou ne'er hast bid a ringlet shine,
Nor given thy locks one graceful twine
    Which I remember not.

There never yet a murmur fell
    From that beguiling tongue,
Which did not, with a lingering spell,
Upon thy charmed senses dwell,
    Like songs from Eden sung.

Ah! that I could, at once, forget
    All, all that haunts me so--
And yet, thou witching girl,--and yet,
To die were sweeter than to let
    The loved remembrance go.

No; if this slighted heart must see
    Its faithful pulse decay,
Oh let it die, remembering thee,
And, like the burnt aroma, be
    Consumed in sweets away.

Give me, my love, that billing kiss
I taught you one delicious night,
When, turning epicures in bliss,
We tried inventions of delight.

Come, gently steal my lips along,
And let your lips in murmurs move, -
Ah, no! - again - that kiss was wrong -
How can you be so dull, my love?

'Cease, cease!' the blushing girl replies -
And in her milky arms she caught me -
'How can you thus your pupil chide;
You know' twas in the dark you taught me!'

   <title>The Lake Of The Dismal Swamp</title>

"They made her a grave, too cold and damp
    "For a soul so warm and true;
"And she's gone to the Lake of the Dismal Swamp,
    "Where, all night long, by a firefly lamp,
"She paddles her white canoe.

"And her fire-fly lamp I soon shall see,
    "And her paddle I soon shall hear;
"Long and loving our life shall be,
"And I'll hide the maid in a cypress tree,
    "When the footstep of death is near."

Away to the Dismal Swamp he speeds--
    His path was rugged and sore,
Through tangled juniper, beds of reeds,
Through many a fen, where the serpent feeds,
    And man never trod before.

And, when on the earth he sunk to sleep
    If slumber his eyelids knew,
He lay, where the deadly vine doth weep
Its venomous tear and nightly steep
    The flesh with blistering dew!

And near him the she-wolf stirred the brake,
    And the copper-snake breathed in his ear,
Till he starting cried, from his dream awake,
"Oh! when shall I see the dusky Lake,
    "And the white canoe of my dear?"

He saw the Lake, and a meteor bright
    Quick over its surface played--
"Welcome," he said, "my dear one's light!"
And the dim shore echoed, for many a night,
    The name of the death-cold maid.

Till he hollowed a boat of the birchen bark,
    Which carried him off from shore;
Far, far he followed the meteor spark,
The wind was high and the clouds were dark,
    And the boat returned no more.

But oft, from the Indian hunter's camp
    This lover and maid so true
Are seen at the hour of midnight damp
To cross the Lake by a fire-fly lamp,
    And paddle their white canoe!

The brilliant black eye
         May in triumph let fly
All its darts without Caring who feels 'em;
         But the soft eye of blue,
         Tho' it scatter wounds too,
Is much better pleased when it heals 'em--
         Dear Fanny!
Is much better pleased when it heals 'em.

         The black eye may say,
         "Come and worship my ray--
"By adoring, perhaps you may move me!"
         But the blue eye, half hid,
         Says from under its lid,
"I love and am yours, if you love me!"
         Yes, Fanny!
         The blue eye, half hid,
         Says, from under its lid,
"I love and am yours, if you love me!"

         Come tell me, then, why
         In that lovely blue eye
Not a charm of its tint I discover;
         Oh why should you wear
         The only blue pair
That ever said "No" to a lover?
        Dear Fanny!
        Oh, why should you wear
        The only blue pair
That ever said "No" to a lover?

   <firstline>Come, tell me, says Rosa, as kissing and kist</firstline>

<body>
"Come, tell me," says Rosa, as kissing and kist,
    One day she reclined on my breast;
"Come, tell me the number, repeat me the list
    "Of the nymphs you have loved and carest."--
Oh Rosa! 'twas only my fancy that roved,
    My heart at the moment was free;
But I'll tell thee, my girl, how many I've loved,
    And the number shall finish with thee.

My tutor was Kitty; in infancy wild
    She taught me the way to be blest;
She taught me to love her, I loved like a child,
    But Kitty could fancy the rest.
This lesson of dear and enrapturing lore
    I have never forgot, I allow:
I have had it very often before,
    But never until now.

Pretty Martha was next, and my soul was all flame,
    But my head was so full of romance
That I fancied her into some chivalry dame,
    And I was her knight of the lance.
But Martha was not of this fanciful school,
    And she laughed at her poor little knight;
While I thought her a goddess, she thought me a fool,
    And I'll swear was most in the right.

My soul was now calm, till, by Cloris's looks,
    Again I was tempted to rove;
But Cloris, I found, was so learned in books
    That she gave me more logic than love.
So I left this young Sappho, and hastened to fly
    To those sweeter logicians in bliss,
Who argue the point with a soul-telling eye,
    And convince us at once with a kiss.

Oh! Susan was then all the world unto me,
    But Susan was piously given;
And the worst of it was, we could never agree
    On the road that was shortest to Heaven.
"Oh, Susan!" I've said, in the moments of mirth,
    "What's devotion to thee or to me?
"I devoutly believe there's a heaven on earth,
    "And believe that that heaven's in !"

When wearied wretches sink to sleep,
How heavenly soft their slumbers lie!
How sweet is death to those who weep,
To those who weep and long to die!

Saw you the soft and grassy bed,
Where flowrets deck the green earth's breast?
'Tis there I wish to lay my head,
'Tis there I wish to sleep at rest.

Oh, let not tears embalm my tomb, --
None but the dews at twilight given!
Oh, let not sighs disturb the gloom, --
None but the whispering winds of heaven!

Take back the sigh thy lips of art
In passion's moment breathed to me;
Yet, no—it must not, will not part,
'Tis now the life-breath of my heart,
And has become too pure for thee!

Take back the kiss, that faithless sigh
With all the warmth of truth imprest:
Yet, no—the fatal kiss may lie,
Upon thy lip its sweets would die,
Or bloom to make a rival blest!

Take back the vows that, night and day
My heart received, I thought, from thine;
Yet, no—allow them still to stay,
They might some other heart betray,
As sweetly as they've ruin'd mine!

Dost thou remember that place so lonely,
A place for lovers and lovers only,

When, as the moonbeam that trembled o'er thee
Illumed thy blushes, I knelt before thee,
    And read my hope's sweet triumph in those eyes?
Then, then, while closely heart was drawn to heart,
Love bound us—never, never more to part!

And when I called thee by names the dearest
That love could fancy, the fondest, nearest,—
    "My life, my only life!" among the rest;
In those sweet accents that still enthral me,
Thou saidst, "Ah!" wherefore thy life thus call me?
    "Thy soul, thy soul's the name I love best;
"For life soon passes,—but how blest to be
"That Soul which never, never parts from thee!"

But her cheek was pale—
    Well-a-day, poor Nanny!  
Nanny, in the field,
